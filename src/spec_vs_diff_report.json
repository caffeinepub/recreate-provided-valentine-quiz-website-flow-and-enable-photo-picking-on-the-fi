  "summary": "The diff is not publish-only: it modifies backend code and project metadata, and adds promotion/smoke-test documentation templates. REQ-23’s “no code/content changes” constraint is violated by the backend/main.mo modification, and REQ-24’s smoke test is not shown as completed (results file is a blank template).",

      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Publish the user-approved preview deployment (Version 25) to the live/production site with no code or content changes (promote the exact approved Version 25 build/commit).",
      "reason": "The diff includes code/project changes, which contradicts the requirement to promote with no additional changes introduced. There is no evidence in the diff of an actual deployment/promotion action; instead there are repository changes.",

      "requirement": "Perform a production smoke test using frontend/PRODUCTION_SMOKE_TEST.md on at least 2 browsers and 2 device types, and document pass/fail (or failures with repro notes).",
      "reason": "A results file was added but it is not filled in (placeholders like \"[To be completed]\" and unchecked items), so there is no evidence the smoke test was actually executed and recorded.",
