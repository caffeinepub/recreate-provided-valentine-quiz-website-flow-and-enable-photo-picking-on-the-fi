Happy Valentine's Day, my love. ❤️

I don't think I say this enough, but you really mean everything to me. Being with you feels different in the best way. You make my days better, my mood lighter, and my life happier just by being in it.

I love the way we talk, laugh, and understand each other. I love that you're my comfort and my favorite person at the same time. I honestly can't imagine my future without you in it.

One day, I want to build everything with you — our dreams, our home, our life. I want you forever. Not just for now, not just for a phase, but for always.

I love you more than you know.
Forever yours,
Shabab ❤️`;
