export const defaultLoveLetter = `My beloved Marianne,

For a long time, I've been haunted by memories of a past relationship. These memories once clouded my present. But one day, everything changed. At some point, I realized that thoughts of Marina no longer occupied my mind. Every moment we spend together, even just watching TV, I find myself falling deeper in love with you. Now, even the gloomiest days are brightened just by your presence. I cherish every moment with you and wouldn't trade it for anything.

It's been an incredible gift, and I thank you for it.

I love you more than words can express, more than anyone else could ever understand. If you ask me, "Do you love me?" to me, it's an obvious, almost rhetorical question.

It's funny how things work. What you may not realize is that being with you makes me feel stronger, more confident, and deeply loved. You give my life purpose and meaning.

All I want is for us to continue growing together, discovering new depths in our relationship. I want us to explore all facets of love, building a bond so deep that our souls become intertwined—a true partnership that transcends all boundaries.

I believe that a loving relationship can give people a second chance at a deeply fulfilling life—emotionally, spiritually, physically. I want to be your rock, especially when times get tough, just as you are mine. ❤️

With all my love,

Nikita`;
